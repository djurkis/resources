A bunch of resources about things that interest me.
Hopefully this repo forces me to improve my organization & and helps you, whoever you are.











* Lectures


* [Google-doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QNFE6jTxma--rYigWdTDNqQopMSDZUafpqTLHo_7Ci8/edit?usp=sharing) of links to papers I will add short summaries of main ideas to practice writing and reading.
